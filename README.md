Students should use this 
[rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. 
Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as 
Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to 
the object the function is called upon. 
Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 
1. Run
& 
2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this

# Impossibru!!
The game goal is to have fun while tackling a challange. And the game gets more difficult the more you play it.
### In order to run the game; open **Index.html** with your browser.
## Game Rules:
-You can use the **up, down, left and right** keyboard buttons (not the wasd).
-The enemies (bugs) can move only from left to right and will apear at random spots each time you score a point.
-In order to win you need to get to the "Water" tyles and press **up**.
-Each time you win your score will increase and so will the difficulty.
-Colliding with one of the bugs will result in **"Death"** which will change your character to the next one in line out of **5 characters**, you can look at them as **5 lives**.
-After you kill all your characters it's **"Game Over!"** and you are back to **score 0** and **level 1** with your initial character.
-**However the stage will not be reset!**.
-**You have to pass the stage in order to keep your total score and reset the stage to stage 2**.
### Lets see how much can you score!
